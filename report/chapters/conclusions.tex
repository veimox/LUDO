\label{sec:conclusion}
A LUDO player based on an Artificial Neural Network and evolved with a Genetic Algorithm has been implemented.
Due to its implementation in multithreading and some studies regarding the number of games to do in a tournament, the learning speed has been improved from the suggested implementation line.
This has lead to a player that in few seconds is able to win not only against the already implemented players, but also the AIs of other students.
